Subject: AWS Solution Proposal for Your Application Scalability and Reliability Needs

Hi Lilly,

Greetings from AWS.

Thank you for your email and for sharing the challenges you are currently facing. After thoroughly reviewing your requirements, we have designed a solution that directly addresses your concerns and will help you achieve greater stability and scalability for your application.

Summary of Challenges Identified:

Increased website traffic leading to occasional server crashes

Higher latency when accessing your website

Increased deployment downtime

Recommended AWS Solution:

Given your needs, we recommend leveraging AWS Elastic Beanstalk for your Python application. This service aligns well with your requirements for scalability, reliability, and minimal deployment downtime. Specifically:

Elastic Beanstalk natively supports Python applications and offers seamless scaling capabilities.

To minimize or eliminate downtime during deployments, we recommend utilizing Elastic Beanstalkâ€™s Blue/Green deployment strategy.

The solution can be further enhanced with additional AWS services to ensure high availability, load balancing, and streamlined deployment processes.

Proposed AWS Services:

Amazon Route 53 for DNS management

Elastic Load Balancing to distribute incoming traffic and improve fault tolerance

Elastic Beanstalk with an Auto Scaling EC2 group for automatic scaling and management

Amazon RDS for managed relational database services

Amazon S3 for scalable object storage

AWS CodePipeline for automated deployment workflows

While an additional availability zone is recommended for improved redundancy, it is optional based on your current requirements.

We are confident that this architecture will resolve your current issues and provide a robust foundation for future growth.

Please let us know if you have any questions or would like to discuss the solution in more detail.

Thank you for considering AWS.

Best regards,
Abhishek Sharma
Solution Architect
